'durarara',jan 18 2015,5,'im going to be blunt this show is simply amazing the sheer amount of characters you get to know and care about  is mind blowing they are all unique and have their own little quirks and yet there is something more to all of them what you see is what you get but its what you dont see that draws you in that much more the pacing characters music voice actors and actresses everything','trying to put words to greatness'

'military',jan 8 2015,5,'the best way i can describe this anime as the three stooges on lsd and speed  it is a crazy slapstick comedy that is full of one liners and scenes that only last seconds  the anime seems nonsensical with crazy action scenes that last seconds and are over before you before you realize what just happened  in some of these scenes there is enough information that you realize that somehow','what the hell happened'
'erased',feb 21 2016,5,'while there are a few good ones this season grimgar etc this one is perfect  rarely do we have this level of gravity and poignancy in anime  for more mature viewers for certain but not necessarily for the subject matter  while the subject is a mature one it is not in any way gory or explicit','this is perfection'

'urahara',oct 8 2017,1,'i dont get it i dont get it at all okay yeah its kindaaaa kinda funny and kinda interesting and the art style reminds me of jet set radio which is nice but this looks like a series of random events which have no apparent relation to each other make no sense dramatically and are mostly explained by x suddenly fell out of the sky if a sensible narrative could be seen here i might dig it','no cause effect to be seen'
'blassreiter',mar 16 2015,5,'it is rare that an anime takes the multi protagonist approach the one takes this approach and develops many characters well including the less significant characters their life events and how these events shape their thoughts are depicted in detail but the plots move on fast some events are cruel and often happen in real life although the anime does make them look less violent or bloody','unconventional mechanism'

'another',jul 7 2013,3,'this anime is good not great but deserves to be watched because of its atmosphere it really sets a good dark theme sense to it it sometimes makes you want to scream at the mere idiocy of some of the characters but in a good way not a top 10 anime but if you like a little blood and final destination like deaths then you will like this','sometimes more funny than scary'
'citrus',apr 24 2018,4,'i really liked it good anime was a little weird at first but i got into it pretty quickley i think its cute  but it does drag on a little bit like one min they kissing about to do something then were back to oh leave me alone basically so annoying but still really enjoyed the anime definetly worth a watch if you love romance','loved it'
'another',aug 23 2014,4,'read the suggestions online for a horror anime and finished the series over a 24 hours span the plot unfolds slowly and although it was a bit predictable in parts i found it just the right level of creepy mysterious and gory  id highly recommend if youre in the mood for a darker anime to kill an afternoon  get comfortable','just the right amount of darkness'
'terraformars',oct 21 2014,1,'just read every chapter of the manga so i was excited they made an anime for this but the cencors completly destroy the story and make it not worth watching yada yada yada so on and so forth it said my review wasnt long enough the end whaaaaaaaat','stupid cencors aaaaaaaaaaaaah'
'occulticnine',dec 30 2016,3,'occulticnine is very fast paced and i was never bored while watching it however it was very difficult to grasp what was going on at several points and the dialogue while well done seems to take up too much of the time the characters are entertaining but come off as simplistic at times watch it if youre interested','interesting but often confusing'
'hanebado',sep 30 2018,1,'id say most everything about this series is good  so why the 1 star im glad you asked  of the two protagonists one has a pretty straightforward motivation the other character however has a more involved plotline the resolution of this plotline is utterly baffling to me a westerner  major spoilers ahead   spoiler alert click to show or hide so ayanos mother world famous badminton ace has left home','perfectly serviceable as a sports anime but a core plotline is baffling'

'overlord',jul 4 2017,5,'this show places the protagonist in a position which is vastly different then any other anime with a similar setting first and foremost he is not human which is why i suspect many people are turned off by this show   it is hard to relate but this is also what makes it interesting because he has all too human characteristics and sometime he blurs the line between a good guy and a bad guy in','one of the most underrated shows out there'

'aldnoahzero',jan 21 2015,3,'this will be a quick targeted review  most people who read a review dont want flowerly language from a wannabe critic so ill get right to the point  this show is great because its pretty much a reversal of the gundam formula  in aldnoahzero the gundams extremely powerful enemies are the bad guys more or less  its up to the main character to find the enemies weaknesses and defeat','a great anime but it could have been better'
'hamatora',apr 3 2014,5,'love this show i like how even thou alot of people are all working together they are always in groups of 2 action animes with a team of 2 are always the best the storyline is perfect and the ending is crazy its something you wouldnt even expect season 2 here we come','one of the best so far'
'reborn',jan 21 2013,4,'the plot is interesting the characters are interesting and it certainly keeps you on your toes however if youre looking for something where the main character is boss status 247 this is not the anime for you i give it a 45 simply because it takes so long for the main character to do something yes character development is important but they totally killed my desire to watch this after','ill bite but its way too slow'
'moyashimon',jan 5 2013,4,'theres a lot of anime out there that recycle the same characters archetypes and stories with only minor tweaks moyashimon starts out that way as the main protagonist has a special ability surprisingly this story didnt take the usual route of clumsy boy with special ability fights evil guy and saves tsundere girl in fact the main protagonist sawaki kun almost plays a supporting role','refreshingly unique and original'
'another',nov 5 2012,3,'before i get started here i know what youre thinking oh great  another  anime review ha priceless good one you guys  another is a suspense fueled pa works produced anime based on a mystery novel of the same name the plot follows protagonist and im going to spell his name out in the same manner that i say it phonetically kowaytchee sakaki borrowjust kidding im enough','another reviewed not so sentimentally from the side of a riverbank'
'citrus',jan 13 2018,5,'this show is based off the manga as far as the first episode goes theyre doing a great job so far it feels like a lot of reviews are stemmed from individuals who never read the manga thus making the rating for this show very mixed  it would be nice if people refrained from having a heart attack over one scene that is not very uncommon to see in anime','off to a great start'
'erased',may 13 2016,5,'its clearly a new classic in anime you cannot go without watching it dont keep wasting your time reading reviews just start watching and enjoy you will learn to love the cliffhangers as they get addressed they add to story and are not just a tool to keep you there  ps soundtrack gets stuck like superglue','a new classic in anime'
'bakemonogatari',mar 31 2014,5,'the story of this anime is sublime i was touched by every characters personal stories and how the main character develops such relationships with them the animation is of really good quality though different from what youd normally be used to i love the music for the series as well each op is tailored for the character they are about and they reflect the characters personality or aura','interesting and touching'
'another',may 12 2018,5,'i first went to watch this assuming that it would be just  another  run of the mill mystery anime or something of the sort but as i watched it it got far more interesting than i thought it would and far more in detail at first i thought they would only briefly mention things like misakis eye but some of them had episodes and half episodes dedicated to just that overall it exceeded','exceeded expectations'
'pandorahearts',jul 3 2015,3,'i liked the series  but by the end of the series i was just confused as the story progressed i felt like it fell apart and that not enough effort was put in to tying the loose ends or even that there should have been a second season and that just never happened so much of the story was just lost and i was left feeling like i had more questions then answers i think that when you watch an anime','i was just confused'
'haikyu',oct 12 2016,5,'as an avid fan of the manga and anime im very glad that season three is finally here this anime gripped me tight and dragged me into its story  plot the characterization is amazing and the amount of development that   all  the characters go through is truly stunning even rewatching previous episodes from seasons one and two i still feel a bit nervous even though i know the outcome of the','the third season is finally here'
'charlotte',nov 24 2017,5,'just wanted to say a few things about the show i just couldnt not say anything after completing it  i just binged watched charlotte and i gotta say it was definitely as the review title says a joyride the show has its ups and downs of being upbeat to serious it was a rollercoaster of emotions also the ending got my feels going a little bit but was an actual ending and a good one at','well this show was a joyride'
'naruto',mar 4 2016,5,'i have known about this anime for a long time and never watched it because i have heard about it from everyone and i thought  i am not going to watch it it is to mainstream but   my brother was watching an episode and instantly i got hooked  everything about it is amazing even the filler episodes and the music story characters just everything in general i love how you are able to feel','for all naruto fans'
'tsugumomo',may 17 2017,1,'this show is a shallow pretense of plot for the sake of pedophiles seriously i was cringing at the love game episode but the loan episode was too much and the preview for the next episode after that was just more of the same mentally mature doesnt change the fact that she has the body of a 10 year old the goddess is even worse shes physically what 8 even considering culture','started out good but'
'berserk',jun 9 2017,1,'i would suggest that they completely fire whoever did this they ruined the release of one of the greatest works of anime by making south park rwby animation whoever made this adaptation should be excluded from touching the praised hiatus masters works and sentenced to the wheel for this atrocity  remove your studios accursed job and go on to other things','poor animation quality'
'hanayamata',nov 6 2014,3,'i liked it although during the first few episodes i thought the pacing was a bit slow and boring it did catch up towards the middle episodes and i liked the way it progressed  the story is about a middle school student who has a very low self esteem until she met hana the transfer foreign student who made friends with her and 3 other girls who have nothing much in commonhanas perkiness and','nice sweet and cute'
'occulticnine',oct 25 2016,3,'i really like it but the voice actor for gamotan is so annoying especially when the radio talks to him and all he does is scream and its getting into my nerves lol i really like the air of mystery that that this anime gives im trying to solve everything in my head right now hopefully they will give me the answers i am looking for','giving this a chance'
'haikyu',aug 3 2014,5,'i am super hyper critical of anything in the media pertaining to my sports i played volleyball for about 8 years as a middle blocker and occasionally an outside hitter wing spiker left side aka asahi and tanaka but haikyu wins everything and probably the sole reason i want to play so badly again  the sequences when theyre playing are absolutely gorgeous true to form and technique it looks','as a middle blocker myself'
'erased',feb 21 2016,5,'this anime has so many elements similar to the death note which i why i love this anime so much it has a very intriguing story and modern like the pace of this is fantastic nothing is more fantastic than a desperate man trying to save his classmate','great anime in a long time'
'another',jun 13 2016,5,'to start with i felt like this was the animated version of   final destination  considering how you can tell when someone is about to die in a ridiculous accident then the plot got a lot deeper and confusing every episode ends on a cliffhanger so for the last week or so ive gotten far too little sleep   but in short this anime is great im not actually a big fan of anime myself','a great anime for rookies'
'spiritpact',feb 5 2017,5,'rating for original chinese version this poor show man the pacing the random jumps it seemed so weird until i did some digging and found out the original chinese version had 15 minute episodes and the japaneses dub basically slapped two episodes together and cut them down to about 24 minutes   after watching all 20 episodes fan subbed i can safely say this was a terrible localization and it','soul contract   why i watch subbed and not dubbed anime in a nutshell'
'gamers',sep 15 2017,2,'the premise of the show wasnt that great but for my surprise it started really nice the problem is that after 3 or 4 episodes everything goes to a loop of romantic comedy imaginary cheating situations shouting with an annoying voice acting and practically zero character or story progress so i am not saying it is completely a waste of time but it will feel like that once you reach the 7th or','started nice but then become annoyingly repetitive'
'nyanbo',sep 26 2016,4,'its its cute its really cute just watch it its only 5 minutes i mean the plot is paper thin the characters are bland but who cares its freaking cute the way they add 3d animation to the real world is cool its like cat videos theyre veritably pointless but by god youll watch it anyway','i i really dont know what to say'
