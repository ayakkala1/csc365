'saki',jun 25 2009,5,'storyline  in my opinion the storyline is awesome and completely takes on a world of its own this anime somewhat relates to anime such as hikaru no go and shion no ou but the family situations in this anime allow it to stand alone even though the story is kind of slow moving with the flashbacks and the many matches the details make it easier for viewers to catch on to what is going','saki an anime that totally caught my attention'

'idolish7',may 18 2018,5,'so i watched this because ive played the game since it released because im a total sucker for rhythm games especially those that have ono kensho egutan and kenn in them haha honestly   this is probably one of the best idol anime period and i hate idol anime theres a real plot that follows the game very well and the characters are actually all developed the animation is a bit more','if youre looking for an idol anime thats actually good'
