('bakuon','2016-05-12',5,'it took me a few episodes but it finally dawned on me that the main character is basically yui and this whole thing is just k on with bikes even the name bakuon is basically k on but with bike instead of a k bike on  not complaining this is a fun show','something seems strangely familiar deja vu'),
('megalobox','2018-04-08',5,'in the first few minutes made me get the same feeling i got when i watch cowboy bebop for the first time it grabbed me and wouldnt let me go i love it when an anime can take me to a new world it wasnt super action packed or anything and i feel like that alone show the skill of the writing and actors the va was on point the art was great the characters got me wanted more and i always love','omg this is shaping up to be a new favorite'),

('magi','2013-02-21',5,'when i first found this i was skeptical about it but after watching a few episodes i found it to be an awesome show love the arabian knights storyline and the spin they gave it was watching on hulu but they didnt update it very fast and found a ton of the episodes here to watch so i was happy','awesome show love it'),
('rwby','2015-01-08',5,'the animation is below par sometimes painful to watch  they dont recap anything  the shows arent set to a standard length  the opening song is oddly short but the voice acting is spectacular  the plot is amazing  the character development couldnt be better  that opening song i mentioned  its beautiful  the animation style actually works well for the battles  dont let this','how do do everything wrongand still win'),
('idolish7','2018-05-18',5,'so i watched this because ive played the game since it released because im a total sucker for rhythm games especially those that have ono kensho egutan and kenn in them haha honestly   this is probably one of the best idol anime period and i hate idol anime theres a real plot that follows the game very well and the characters are actually all developed the animation is a bit more','if youre looking for an idol anime thats actually good');
